# Tower_Game
In this code, I have to tired to make terminal game which follows the rules of "Tower Of Hanoi", Code is in java.

<-- Points Regarding Game & Program -->

As we know that in "Tower Of Hanoi" you can't put a "Bigger Disk" over a "Smaller Disk" same as that i have followed that rule but by using numbers, so if a person will try
to put a Bigger Number over a Smaller Number it will be consider as an "Invalid Move".

When the user runs the program it first shows 6 Numbers with a lable with text "Rod A" and "Rod B" (3 Number below Rod A text,3 Number below Rod B text), There are three Rods
in this program (Rod A ,B,C) Rob C will be Empty at the start of program.

After that the user will have to enter the name of the rod from which he wants to remove a number and then the program will ask for the "Rod Name" in which he wants to enter the
removed number. After this program will ask "that you want to continue or not" in this step program will take a boolean input.

After arranging values in right from in a single Rod program will show to that have you won or not, And it will show a Diagram of "Tower" that you have made, if it id right.
